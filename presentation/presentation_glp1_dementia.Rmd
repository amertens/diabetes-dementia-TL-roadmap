## Motivation

- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a cardiometabolic disease affecting over 6% of the global population, and 15-20% of the global population of those over the age of 50 as of 2017 (and trending upward) (Khan et al. 2020; Lin et al. 2020)
- Increasing evidence has linked T2DM to dementia (Campbell et al. 2018; Huang 2016)
- Control of diabetes is generally addressed using first-line medications (namely metformin), but second-line regimes (such as GLP-1 receptor agonists/GLP-1RA or SGLT2 inhibitors) are increasingly used as well 
- There is substantial evidence that diabetes medication, including second line regimes like GLP-1, can decrease dementia risk (Duarte et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2020)

## Motivation

- GLP-1RAs are a relatively new treatment for diabetes; some forms have been ion the market since 2005, others as recently as 2013 (White 2015)
- There is reason to believe that GLP-1 is particularly neuroprotective (Duarte et al. 2013), but most studies have been associational and have not compared head-to-head with other second-line regimes; causal analysis is warranted

## Causal question

What is the effect of cumulative exposure to GLP-1RAs vs. active comparator (other second line, SLGT2i) on dementia?

## Target trial and counterfactual

In our ideal experiment we would enroll T2DM patients who are:

- over 40 years old;
- have least five years on a first-line treatment;
- are beginning a second line treatment (namely GLP-1 or SGLT2i) for the first time.

Causal quantity:

$Y_{\bar{a}} = f_Y(\bar{L}(t),\bar{a}(t), U_{Y})$, where $\bar{a} \in {0,1}$ and denotes the counterfactual exposure history.

## Intervention on the SCM

How would expected dementia risk have differed if all subjects had used GLP-1RAs throughout follow up vs. if they used SLGT2i throughout follow up?

$$ E(Y_{\bar{a}=1}-Y_{\bar{a}=0}) $$

## Observed data and link to causal model

We will emulate our target trial using observational data from an expansive cohort of over 42,000 Danish diabetes patients beginning a second-line regime after 2015.

```{r}
include_graphics(c("consort.png"))
```


Due to Danish registry access issues, for the purposes of this analysis we used simulated data.

## Simulations

- We simulated the data by drawing samples from the discrete multivariate probability distributions of our X variables from Danish Registry summary statistics
- Exposure and time-varying confounder data were aggregated into discrete classes for simplicity and data privacy
- Other univariate distributions were known but not included in the current analysis because without the multivariate distribution that includes other X variables, these variables would only add noise to the estimation

```{r, echo=F, include=F}
library(dplyr)
data <- rio::import("../simulated data/novo_registry_simulated.RDS")
names(data)
table(data$age)
data$age<- factor(data$age,labels=c("41-50","51-60","61-70","71-80","81-90"))
table(data$age)
table(data$sex)
data$sex<- factor(data$sex,labels=c("Male","Female"))
table(data$dementia, data$T3)

subset <- data %>% select(age,sex,kidney_1,obese_1,T1)
subset <- data.frame(apply(subset, 2,function(x) factor(x)))
names(subset) <- c("any_dementia","Age","Sex","BL kidney disease","BL obesity","GLP1 Use" )
table1 <- print(tableone::CreateTableOne(data=subset,vars=c("Age","Sex","BL kidney disease","BL obesity"),strata= "GLP1 Use"))

table1 <- table1[,1:3]
```

## A review of the statistical model and estimand (point treatment)

Target parameter is the average treatment effect (ATE):

$$\Psi(P_0) = E_W[E_0(Y|A=1,W) - E(Y|A=0,W)]$$

Under the randomization and positivity assumptions, one way to estimate this is through the G-Computation formula:
$$\hat{\Psi}(P_n) = E(Y_a) = \sum_w E_0(Y|A=a,W=w)P_0(W=w)$$

<!-- 1)  Estimate $E(Y|A,W) \equiv \bar{Q}^0_n(A,W)$ -->
<!-- 2)  Estimate the treatment mechanism $g_0(A|W)$ and clever covariate $H_n(A,W)$ -->
<!-- 3)  Modify initial estimate with clever covariate -->
<!-- 4)  Calculate counterfactual outcomes under treatment -->
<!-- 5)  Take empirical mean -->
<!-- $$ $$ -->

## The longitudinal case

Time-dependent confounding complicates our ability to estimate the ATE

```{r}
include_graphics("identifiability.png")
```
- if we adjust for L naively, we lose the effect of A(1) through L(2), we can't stratify on descendants of A

...what to do?

## Statistical model and estimand for longitudinal data

We want to estimate the ATE of the counterfactual treatment histories ($\bar{a}$) of continuously exposed to GLP-1 ($\bar{a}=1$) and continously exposed to SGLT2i ($\bar{a}=0$):

$$ E(Y_{\bar{a}=1}-Y_{\bar{a}=0}) $$



To account for the time-dependent nature of the confounding variables, we used longitudinal estimators.

## Longitudinal conterfactual estimators

In longitudinal target parameters, we must evaluate them such that we do not condition on descendants of our treatment node.

In the case of G-Comp, one way to side step this is through a series of conditional expectations:

$$E_{P\bar{a}}(Y_{\bar{a}}) = E(E(...E(E(Y_{\bar{a}}|\bar{L}_{\bar{a}}(K))|\bar{L}_{\bar{a}}(K-1))...|L(1)))$$

Where $$\bar{L}_{\bar{a}} \equiv \bar{L}(K),\bar{A}(K)$$
<!-- (One way to estimate these is through sequential regression.) -->

## Longitudinal conterfactual estimators

I don't know about you, but for it was helpful to look at a two time-unit example:

$$E( E( E(Y|A(2)=1,A(1)=1,L(2),L(1))|A(1)=1,L(1)))$$

Summing over the covariate distributions...
\small
$$\sum_{l(1)}  \left[ \sum_{l(2)}E(Y|\bar{L}=\bar{l},\bar{A}=1)P(L(2)=l(2)|A(1)=1,L(1)=l(1)\right]P(L(1)=l(1))$$
\normalsize

<!-- 1)  Estimate $E(Y|A,W) \equiv \bar{Q}^0_n(A,W)$ -->
<!-- 2)  Estimate the treatment mechanism $g_0(A|W)$ and clever covariate $H_n(A,W)$ -->
<!-- 3)  Modify initial estimate with clever covariate -->
<!-- 4)  Calculate counterfactual outcomes under treatment -->
<!-- 5)  Take empirical mean -->

## A note on identifiability in longitudinal data

- In longitudinal analyses, time-dependent confounding makes identifiability more complicated.

We must assess independence sequentially:
$$
Y_{\bar{a}} \perp \!\!\! \perp A(t) | \bar{L}(t), \bar{A}(t-1)
$$

This is called the sequential randomization assumption, analog to the point-treatment randomization assumption, which we will assume is met for the purpose of this analysis.


## Analysis

After smoothing over 6-month gaps of GLP-1 and SGLT2i exposure, we constrasted dementia outcomes between T2DM patients with continuous GLP-1 exposure and T2DM patients with continuous SGLT2i exposure.

We used the l-TMLE package to estimate the target parameters of interest (GComp, IPTW, TMLE).

For the purposes of the project we used a simplified SuperLearner list that included only SL.mean, SL.glm, SL.glmnet.


## Preliminary results

```{r, echo=F,include=T, out.width="90%", out.height="75%"}

include_graphics(c("forestplot.png"))

```

## Preliminary results

- We found a 0.15% (95% CI -0.23%, -0.01%) decrease in the risk of disease among GLP-1 users compared to SGLT2i users

- Under sequential randomization and positivity assumptions, we can interpret this result causally: 

*The risk of dementia was 0.15% lower under an intervention in which all diabetes patients used GLP-1RAs, compared to an intervention in which they all used SGLT2i.*



## Causal assumptions in context

- Unfortunately, our ability to causally interpret the parameter is weakened by the unmeasured confounding. 
- We have limited access to vital sign and lab data on only a subsample of Danish regions, which may lead to time-dependent confounding by time-varying blood glucose (or other relevant biomarkers such as cholesterol or blood pressure).
- We will address this in future by performing sensivitiy analyses restricting to areas in which biomarker data is available.

## Discussion

- In our simulated data set with a limited covariate set, we found small but significant differences in dementia risk between GLP-1 users and SGLT2i users
- While the effect is small, in the context of the population of over 217,000 diabetes patients; an intervention on the population would prevent 325 cases of dementia
- Further analysis will be needed, including replication on the actual registry data

## Future directions

This is an admittedly limited first analysis, and we plan to expand by:

- Improving candidate learners
- Examining additional second line treatments (eg. DPP4)
- Allowing for dynamic treatment regimes
- Using continuous time TMLE
- Testing for robustness of the estimate across repeated simulations of the data
- Examining additional outcomes (death, cardiovascular disease)
- Running on the real data!
